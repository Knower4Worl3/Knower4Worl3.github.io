### what is the red team ....
Cybersecurity is a constant race between white hat hackers and black hat hackers. As threats in the cyber-world evolve, so does the need for more specialized services that allow companies to prepare for real attacks the best they can.

While conventional security engagements like vulnerability assessments and penetration tests could provide an excellent overview of the technical security posture of a company, they might overlook some other aspects that a real attacker can exploit. In that sense, we could say that conventional penetration tests are good at showing vulnerabilities so that you can take proactive measures but might not teach you how to respond to an actual ongoing attack by a motivated adversary.
